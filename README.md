# Eat-Da-Burger

Burger logger with MySQL, Node.js, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Follows the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

## Getting Started

App will have a text box asking for you to input a custom burger. Once added to the database, it will give you the option
to "devour" the burger. This will change the database and re-render the HTML appropriately.
